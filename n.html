         <br>
         Prasad served as 1st Minister of Food and Agriculture in the central government from 1947 to 1948. <br>
         Upon independence in 1947, Prasad was elected as President of the

         <a  class="text-decoration" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1950_Indian_presidential_election">elected</a>
         as its first president by the Constituent <br>
          Assembly. As president, Prasad established a tradition for non-partisanship and independence for the office-<br/>
          bearer and retired from Congress party politics. Although a ceremonial head of state, Prasad encouraged the <br>
           development of education in India and advised the Nehru government on several occasions. In 1957, Prasad <br>
           was
           <a  class="text-decoration" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1957_Indian_presidential_election">re-elected to the President_of_India</a>
           , becoming the only president to serve two full terms. Prasad stayed in office <br>
            for the longest term of around 12 years. Post the completion of his tenure, he quit the Congress and set up <br>
             new guidelines for parliamentarians which are still followed.
